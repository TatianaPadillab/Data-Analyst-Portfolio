### Adventure Works - Quarterly Sales Performance Dashboard Using Microsoft Power BI

[Publication](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/670cdae3-5544-4b39-85f2-ee44ae2eb6ac/ReportSection6eb9e839d2d78881aa25?language=en-US&experience=power-bi)

This project was for Adventure Works, a multinational bicycle manufacturer. The goal was to provide the executive board and sales management team with insights into quarterly sales performance to support strategic decision-making for the upcoming quarter.
I developed a detailed dashboard in Power BI Desktop to offer an overview of quarterly sales performance for the executive board. A separate, interactive report was created for the sales management team to explore sales data in greater detail. The analysis highlighted trends in sales by region, category, and salesperson, and summarized key takeaways for both the board of directors and the sales management team.

By reviewing the dataset and selecting appropriate visualizations, I was able to present a clear and engaging narrative of the sales performance. The final report was published on the Power BI service, where the executive board could access a high-level dashboard, while the sales management team could delve into a granular report for more detailed insights.

### Comprehensive Analysis of National Test Results Using Excel

Excel was used to gather and analyze national test results of the students, comparing data across different cities, states, institutions, and programs. The data was meticulously organized and cleaned for accuracy, with key metrics such as averages and standard deviations calculated using various statistical functions. Pivot tables and charts were created to facilitate a clear comparative analysis, providing a visual representation of the results.

[Publication](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tatiana.padilla/viz/MinnesotaDepartmentofTransportation_17169460487550/Dashboard1)

This dashboard was made for monitoring traffic patterns. The objective was to gain insights into traffic volume throughout the year, organized by year, month, week, day, and hour, as well as traffic volume under different weather conditions and on various holidays. Understanding these traffic patterns would help the department make crucial infrastructure decisions, ensuring that future construction projects do not disrupt traffic flow.

The Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Data was loaded into Tableau Public and created comprehensive visualizations. These visualizations provided clear insights into how traffic patterns varied across different times and conditions. The project equipped the Minnesota Department of Transportation with the tools and information necessary to plan and execute infrastructure projects with minimal impact on drivers, thereby improving overall traffic management and planning.
